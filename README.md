# PicACard
I wrote this script to automate the random generation of workouts for the "deck of cards" work out challenges.

Basic output:

[alex@feh ~]$ ./picacard
+====================================+
|    PicACard - Your Random Card     |
|         workout generator.         |
+====================================+
|      Today's workout:   core       |
+------------------------------------+
|    Spades     :  coreout5          |
|    Diamonds   :  coreout9          |
|    Clubs      :  coreout3          |
|    Hearts     :  coreout8          |
+------------------------------------+
|    Numbers    =  # of Reps         |
|    Jacks      =  12 reps           |
|    Queens     =  15 reps           |
|    Kings      =  20 reps           |
|    Aces       =  25 reps           |
+------------------------------------+
| Draw two cards of same value in a  |
|  row doubles the number of reps.   |
+------------------------------------+

Script is functional. I just need to finish filling out the arm, leg, and core workout lists.
